# Case Study: Wealthfront: Your easiest financial decision

  2008 and launched its service in 2011.

* Who are the founders of the company?

  Founded by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in 2008.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  After a successful career as the co-founder of VC firm Benchmark Capital, Wealthfront co-founder Andy Rachleff kicked back into a relaxed retirement. He saw a need to democratize access to sophisticated investment products. The two realized they not only shared a mission — to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice — they agreed that software could unlock great investing for everyone. So they gathered some of the best technical minds they knew.

That was the day Wealthfront was formed.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  Their goal is to minimize taxes. Though you may not see short-term capital gains, you’ll get your money’s worth come tax time from Wealthfront’s daily tax-loss harvesting — a service available to all investors.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Investors with small balances or beginning investors
Not every robo-advisor offers personalized portfolio management for accounts with $500 balances. And new investors benefit from expert advice.

Investors with balances of $100,000 or more
At the other end of the spectrum, Wealthfront’s higher-balance users grow more wealth and pay fewer taxes through the PassivePlus plan.

Passive investors
Wealthfront does the work for you using Modern Portfolio Theory, so you won’t have to select or keep up with individual securities.

Goal setters
The planning arm of Wealthfront is designed to consider your financial big picture. The Path feature balances multiple savings goals, crunches the numbers, and helps you prioritize.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

  PassivePlus® is our suite of investment strategies grounded in academic research and brought to life by software. We didn’t invent these strategies, but our technology has made them available to a new generation of investors.

Our software automatically looks for opportunities to execute these strategies. No time, no work, no reasons left to procrastinate.

Their software readjusts as needed through a technique called threshold-based rebalancing; once an asset crosses a predetermined “threshold” Wealthfront re-allocates your investments. They’ll also move assets around when the market fluctuates, dividends get reinvested, or money is deposited or withdrawn. You can change your risk score, though it takes time for Wealthfront to switch your assets accordingly.
