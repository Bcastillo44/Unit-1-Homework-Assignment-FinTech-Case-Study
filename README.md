# Case Study - Wealthfront - Your Easiest Financial Decision

## Overview and Origin


  Wealthfront Corporation by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in 2008 and launched its online service platform in 2011. After a successful career as the co-founder of VC firm Benchmark Capital, Wealthfront co-founder Andy Rachleff saw a need to democratize access to sophisticated investment products. He and Dan Carroll realized they not only shared a mission — to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice — they agreed that software could unlock great investing for everyone.
  
  Wealthfront is funded by 38 investors. DAG Ventures and Spark Capital are the most recent investors. They have had several rounds of funding noted below, with their latest funding round concluding on Jan 4, 2018.
  
•	Series A - $7,500,000
•	Series B - $20,000,000
•	Series C - $35,000,000
•	Series D - $64,000,000
•	Series E - $75,000,000

  Wealthfront’s overall goal is to maximize gains with algorithmic portfolio management and asset allocation while minimizing tax payments for their clients. Though you may not see short-term capital gains, you’ll get your money’s worth come tax time from Wealthfront’s daily tax-loss harvesting — a service available to all investors. Their clients range from investors with small balances or beginning investors to investors with balances of $100,000 or more. New
 investors benefit from expert advice, and at the other end of the spectrum, Wealthfront’s higher-balance users grow more wealth and pay fewer taxes through their patented PassivePlus plan. Wealthfront does the work for you using Modern Portfolio Theory, so you won’t have to select or keep up with individual securities. The planning arm of Wealthfront is designed to consider your financial big picture. The “Path” feature balances multiple savings goals crunch the numbers, and help you prioritize.
 
 PassivePlus® is their suite of investment strategies grounded in academic research and brought to life by their software. Their technology has made them available to a new generation of investors and their software automatically looks for opportunities to execute these strategies.  Their software readjusts as needed through a technique called threshold-based rebalancing; once an asset crosses a predetermined “threshold” Wealthfront re-allocates your investments. They’ll also move assets around when the market fluctuates, dividends get reinvested, or money is deposited or withdrawn. You can change your risk score, though it takes time for Wealthfront to switch your assets accordingly.

Above this basic level of service, several robo-advisors offer tax-loss harvesting services for portfolios that are not tax-advantaged in some way. Many now offer tax optimization strategies standard, but keep in mind that tax-loss harvesting is not always beneficial—it all depends on your tax situation. Wealthfront is the only robo-advisor who offers both investment management and financial planning. Clients receive a personalized, globally diversified investment portfolio that is managed for them when they open an account. Wealthfront provides data-driven, actionable recommendations to improve net-of-fee, after-tax, risk-adjusted returns. With an annual advisory fee of 0.25%, users can monitor their real-time investment performance, review recent transactions, receive financial advice, and manage their deposits.  


## Landscape

  Robo-Advising is a highly popular automated financial service that uses algorithms and machine learning to offer investment advice and management to users. Thus, they not only consider investment opportunities, but they also respect a user’s goals, income, marital status, and risk aversion, among other factors. 

By Q4 of 2019, the top five robo-advisors had a combined AUM of 187.5BB with Schwab (37BB) charging a 0% management fee by exclusively marketing their own funds. Other services like Betterment have tiered services: 0.25% of AUM for accounts valued up to $100k or 0.4% for assets over $100k for a premium plan that provides access to Certified Financial Planners. Consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers speculates that the market can increase by over 800BB in the next five years. (Asset Management 2020: A Brave New World, PwC.) Niche investing within the robo-advisor space is becoming an increasingly popular trend with services rendering portfolios that are themed towards specific sectors, such as tech-takeout targets, defense and those focusing on dividend yield.

The most significant opportunity within the robo-advisor space may be the integration of Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and providing the architecture that allows users assign individual preferences to their portfolios. Bank of America has reported that SRI is a priority for at least half of millennials regardless of net worth. (2013 U.S. Trust Insights On Wealth and Worth, U.S. Trust.) 

Wealthfront is the second largest independent robo-advisor, after Betterment. And while dozens of robo-advisors have arrived in recent years, Wealthfront stands out as one of the very best. There isn’t any one thing Wealthfront does especially well, but many. And they’re adding to their menu of services all the time.

## Results

   There are two financial innovations that are generally considered to have been clearly positive for society. One is the ATM, and the other is passive investing. Passive investors simply pay a very modest fee to buy a broad, predetermined, diversified basket of stocks. The biggest passive managers, Vanguard and Blackrock, are now the undisputed giants of the asset-management space, each controlling trillions of dollars. Led by Wealthfront and Betterment, these firms are young, mobile-first, and backed by millions of venture capital dollars. 

Core Metrics 

   Portfolio Management - Modern Portfolio Theory
   
  Wealthfront aims to deliver an automated investment management service that maximizes the long-term, net-of-fee, after-tax, real investment return for each client’s particular tolerance for risk.  Optimal portfolios are identified using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and combine a broad set of asset classes, each usually represented by a low-cost, passive ETF.
   
   Asset Allocation 
   
  Wealthfront determines the optimal mix of our chosen asset classes by using Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz, 1952), the foundation of Modern Portfolio Theory. The output of the optimization is a collection of portfolios that generate the maximum return at each level of targeted risk, or equivalently, minimize the level of risk for a specific expected return. Collectively these portfolios form the (mean-variance) efficient frontier.
   
   Tax-loss Harvesting
   
For taxable accounts, Wealthfront offers the Wealthfront daily tax-loss harvesting service for no additional charge. We monitor your portfolio daily to look for opportunities to harvest losses on the ETFs that represent each asset class in your portfolio. Under the right circumstances we will sell one of your ETFs that is trading at a loss and replace it with an alternative ETF that tracks a different, but highly correlated index to maintain the risk and return characteristics of your portfolio. 

The best robo-advisors offer easy account setup, robust goal planning, account services, portfolio management, and security features, attentive customer service, comprehensive education, and low fees. The popularity of robo-advisors has not been lost on major players in the financial services industry. Fidelity Investments has forged an arrangement with Betterment, the human advisors on Fidelity's team can offer a version of Betterment's professional Registered Investment Advisor platform to their clients. Vanguard has its own version of a low-cost robo-advisor, as does Charles Schwab Corp. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios raised a stir when it launched its no-fee service in 2017. Schwab plans to make money on the assets under management.

When considering a robo-advisor, affiliations with major firms like Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab might be something to consider. These companies have the money to invest and the time to allow these services to grow. Additionally, as your needs change or if you desire a more personal touch, you will be positioned to transition seamlessly to other services offered by these firms.


## Recommendations

  If I were to advise the company, I would suggest they lower their minimum balance requirement to $0. Though $500.00 is still among the lowest minimum requirements compared with the competitors, a $0 minimum I believe attracts more beginner investors that may not have $500 laying around but want to pursue a robo-advisor with a small amount and build up deposits over time. They have found their niche client, and they should do all they can to hold those clients as long as they can. The other product I would advise that could also help with the lower account minimum are the introduction of buying fractional shares into their stock portfolio features. Fractional shar buying has become a huge advantage for first-time investors that don’t have large amounts of capital to invest in some of the strongest and reliable companies that have a large share price, for example Amazon. This allows more entrants into the market, and also creates a sense of ownership on the client side that they can buy pieces of companies that may have large shar prices but are companies that can withstand strong financial headwinds and large market fluctuations.
  
  The main technology it would utilize would be on the mobile platform. Robinhood, for example, introduced fractional shares this year and the ease-of-use on their mobile applicatin has drastically grown their client size and usability of choosing which stocks to pursue based on the balance in your account. A reliable and intuitive mobile application platform would bring in their niche client, millenials, who value easy-to-use and interactive financial platforms via their cellphone.
