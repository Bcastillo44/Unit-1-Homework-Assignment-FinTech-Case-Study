# Case Study - Wealthfront - Your Easiest Financial Decision

  Wealthfront Corporation 

* When was the company incorporated?

  2008 and launched its service in 2011.

* Who are the founders of the company?

  Founded by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll in 2008.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

  After a successful career as the co-founder of VC firm Benchmark Capital, Wealthfront co-founder Andy Rachleff kicked back into a relaxed retirement. He saw a need to democratize access to sophisticated investment products. The two realized they not only shared a mission — to help democratize access to sophisticated financial advice — they agreed that software could unlock great investing for everyone. So they gathered some of the best technical minds they knew.

That was the day Wealthfront was formed.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
  
  Wealthfront is funded by 38 investors. DAG Ventures and Spark Capital are the most recent investors.
  
  Series A - $7,500,000
  Series B - $20,000,000
  Series C - $35,000,000
  Series D - $64,000,000
  Series E - $75,000,000

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  Their goal is to minimize taxes. Though you may not see short-term capital gains, you’ll get your money’s worth come tax time from Wealthfront’s daily tax-loss harvesting — a service available to all investors.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Investors with small balances or beginning investors
Not every robo-advisor offers personalized portfolio management for accounts with $500 balances. And new investors benefit from expert advice.

Investors with balances of $100,000 or more
At the other end of the spectrum, Wealthfront’s higher-balance users grow more wealth and pay fewer taxes through the PassivePlus plan.

Passive investors
Wealthfront does the work for you using Modern Portfolio Theory, so you won’t have to select or keep up with individual securities.

Goal setters
The planning arm of Wealthfront is designed to consider your financial big picture. The Path feature balances multiple savings goals, crunches the numbers, and helps you prioritize.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

  PassivePlus® is our suite of investment strategies grounded in academic research and brought to life by software. We didn’t invent these strategies, but our technology has made them available to a new generation of investors.

Our software automatically looks for opportunities to execute these strategies. No time, no work, no reasons left to procrastinate.

Their software readjusts as needed through a technique called threshold-based rebalancing; once an asset crosses a predetermined “threshold” Wealthfront re-allocates your investments. They’ll also move assets around when the market fluctuates, dividends get reinvested, or money is deposited or withdrawn. You can change your risk score, though it takes time for Wealthfront to switch your assets accordingly.

Above this basic level of service, several robo-advisors offer tax-loss harvesting services for portfolios that are not tax-advantaged in some way. Many now offer tax optimization strategies standard, but keep in mind that tax-loss harvesting is not always beneficial—it all depends on your tax situation.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

  Robo-Advising: highly popular automated services that use algorithms and machine learning to offer investment advice and management to their users. Thus, they not only consider investment opportunities, but they also respect a user’s goals, income, marital status, and risk aversion, among other factors.
  
  Wealthfront is the only robo advisor who offers both investment management and financial planning. Clients receive a personalized, globally-diversified investment portfolio that is managed for them when they open an account.

Wealthfront provides data-driven, actionable recommendations to improve net-of-fee, after-tax, risk-adjusted returns. With an annual advisory fee of 0.25%, users can monitor their real-time investment performance, review recent transactions, receive financial advice, and manage their deposits.  

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

  For those unaware, robo-advisors are an emerging sector in wealth management that package Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), cash management and even some financial planning within a simple application, often on mobile devices. By Q4 of 2019, the top five robo-advisors had a combined AUM of 187.5BB with Schwab (37BB) charging a 0% management fee by exclusively marketing their own funds. Other services like Betterment have tiered services: 0.25% of AUM for accounts valued up to $100k or 0.4% for assets over $100k for a premium plan that provides access to Certified Financial Planners. Consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers speculates that the market can increase by over 800BB in the next five years. (2. Asset Management 2020: A Brave New World, PwC.) Niche investing within the robo-advisor space is becoming an increasingly popular trend with services rendering portfolios that are themed towards specific sectors, such as tech-takeout targets, defense and those focusing on dividend yield. The most significant opportunity within the robo-advisor space may be the integration of Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and providing the architecture that allows users assign individual preferences to their portfolios. Bank of America has reported that SRI is a priority for at least half of millennials regardless of net worth. (3. 2013 U.S. Trust Insights On Wealth and Worth, U.S. Trust.)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

That said, there are two financial innovations that are generally considered to have been clearly positive for society. One is the ATM, for reasons which should be self-explanatory. The other is passive investing. Rather than pay a financial professional large amounts of money to pick securities for them, passive investors simply pay a very modest fee to buy a broad, predetermined, diversified basket of stocks. It’s easier, it’s much cheaper, and it almost always outperforms the active investors over the long term. The biggest passive managers, Vanguard and Blackrock, are now the undisputed giants of the asset-management space, each controlling trillions of dollars. Led by Wealthfront and Betterment, these firms are young, mobile-first, and backed by millions of venture capital dollars. They know where the puck is headed (millennials investing passively), they’re up to speed on all the latest behavioral economics, and they can use modern technology to make it easier than ever to just hand your money over, answer a few questions about your risk appetite, and sit back, safe in the knowledge that no one’s going to be gambling your money away.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

   Portfolio Management - Modern Portfolio Theory
   
    Wealthfront aims to deliver an automated investment management service that maximizes the long-term, net-of-fee, after-tax, real investment return for each client’s particular tolerance for risk.  Optimal portfolios are identified using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and combine a broad set of asset classes, each usually represented by a low-cost, passive ETF.
   
   Asset Allocation 
   
   Wealthfront determines the optimal mix of our chosen asset classes by using Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz, 1952), the foundation of Modern Portfolio Theory. The output of the optimization is a collection of portfolios that generate the maximum return at each level of targeted risk, or equivalently, minimize the level of risk for a specific expected return. Collectively these portfolios form the (mean-variance) efficient frontier.
   
   Tax-loss Harvesting
   
   For taxable accounts, Wealthfront offers the Wealthfront daily tax-loss harvesting service for no additional charge. We monitor your portfolio daily to look for opportunities to harvest losses on the ETFs that represent each asset class in your portfolio. Under the right circumstances we will sell one of your ETFs that is trading at a loss and replace it with an alternative ETF that tracks a different, but highly correlated index to maintain the risk and return characteristics of your portfolio. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

  The best robo-advisors offer easy account setup, robust goal planning, account services, portfolio management, and security features, attentive customer service, comprehensive education, and low fees.
  
  The popularity of robo-advisors has not been lost on major players in the financial services industry. Fidelity Investments has forged an arrangement with Betterment, one of the oldest (founded in 2008) robo-advisors; the human advisors on Fidelity's team can offer a version of Betterment's professional Registered Investment Advisor platform to their clients. Fidelity has inked a deal with LearnVest as well.

Vanguard has its own version of a low-cost robo-advisor, as does Charles Schwab Corp. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios raised a stir when it launched its no-fee service in 2017. Schwab plans to make money on the assets under management ($5,000 is the minimum portfolio size).

When considering a robo-advisor, affiliations with major firms like Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab might be something to consider. These companies have the money to invest and the time to allow these services to grow. Additionally, as your needs change or if you desire a more personal touch, you will be positioned to transition seamlessly to other services offered by these firms.
